Pineapple originated in the Amazon River Basin of Brazil and Paraguay in South America, and was introduced from Brazil to China in the 16th 
century. It has spread throughout the tropics. The edible part is mainly composed of the inflorescence axis with increased meat and the flowers
 arranged in the peripheral spiral. The flowers are usually not strong, and the persistent perianth lobes are enclosed in a cavity, and the cavity is
 covered with shrunk stamens and styles. The fibers of leaves are tough and can be used for fabric, rope making, netting and papermaking.
